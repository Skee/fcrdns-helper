## fcrdns-helper ##
A pdns pipe backend worker for enabling [forward-confirmed reverse DNS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward-confirmed_reverse_DNS) for entire IP blocks.


### _Requirements_ ###

- pdns
- pdns-backend-pipe
- perl
- Encode::Wordlist::PGP from CPAN
- control of your classes' NS and a domain name for hostnames


### _pdns.conf_ ###

    listen=pipe
    pipe-command=/home/pdns/fcrdns-helper/worker.pl

    # Use sufficient distributor-threads so you don't lag. I use 40 for a /19 used for webhosting.
    distributor-threads=40

    # cache is always good, take a look at query-cache-ttl, negquery-cache-ttl


### _Modus operandi_ ###

PTR records are generated by replacing each byte in the IP address with the corresponding
word in the [PGP word list](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGP_word_list), followed by a suffix.
The suffix needs to be a domain or subdomain name that you control and has to be delegated to
the same nameservers, so A queries for forward DNS work as well.

    $ host 178.157.83.1
    1.83.157.178.in-addr.arpa domain name pointer sawdust-Ohio-dwelling-adviser.static.reverse.newhost.ro.
    $ host sawdust-Ohio-dwelling-adviser.static.reverse.newhost.ro.
    sawdust-Ohio-dwelling-adviser.static.reverse.newhost.ro has address 178.157.83.1

I use .static.reverse.newhost.ro, with static.reverse being IN NS to the nameservers with
fcrdns-helper, where the IP classes are also resolved.
